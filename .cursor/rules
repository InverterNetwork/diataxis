# Diátaxis Documentation Framework Rules

## Overview
This repository uses the Diátaxis framework to organize documentation into four distinct types.
All documentation contributions must follow these standards.

## The Four Quadrants

### 1. Tutorials (`docs/tutorials/`)
- **Purpose**: Learning-oriented, hands-on lessons
- **Audience**: Newcomers who need to learn
- **Style**:
  - Guide the reader step-by-step
  - Focus on learning by doing
  - Ensure success - the reader should complete something working
  - Explain only what's necessary for the task
  - Use concrete examples, not abstract concepts
- **Naming**: `{number}-{topic}.md` (e.g., `01-getting-started.md`)

### 2. How-to Guides (`docs/how-to/`)
- **Purpose**: Task-oriented, practical directions
- **Audience**: Competent users who need to accomplish something
- **Style**:
  - Focus on achieving a specific goal
  - Assume the reader knows the basics
  - Be direct and practical
  - List prerequisites upfront
  - Provide complete, working solutions
- **Naming**: `how-to-{action}-{subject}.md` (e.g., `how-to-deploy-module.md`)

### 3. Reference (`docs/reference/`)
- **Purpose**: Information-oriented, technical descriptions
- **Audience**: Users who need accurate, complete information while working
- **Style**:
  - Be accurate, complete, and consistent
  - Structure for quick lookup (tables, lists)
  - Describe things as they are, not how to use them
  - Match the structure of the codebase
  - No tutorials or explanations - just facts
- **Naming**: Match code structure (e.g., `sdk-api.md`, `contracts/module-factory.md`)

### 4. Explanation (`docs/explanation/`)
- **Purpose**: Understanding-oriented, discussion and context
- **Audience**: Users who want to understand concepts deeply
- **Style**:
  - Explain "why" not just "what"
  - Provide context and background
  - Discuss alternatives and trade-offs
  - Connect concepts to each other
  - Can be opinionated
- **Naming**: `{concept}.md` (e.g., `architecture-decisions.md`, `module-system.md`)

## Writing Standards

### Frontmatter Required
Every document must include YAML frontmatter:
```yaml
---
title: "Document Title"
type: tutorial | how-to | reference | explanation
status: draft | review | published
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
author: name or AI
tags: [tag1, tag2]
---
```

### Markdown Standards
- Use ATX-style headers (`#`, `##`, `###`)
- One sentence per line for better diffs
- Code blocks must specify language
- Use relative links between docs
- Images go in `docs/assets/`

### AI-Generated Content
- Mark AI-generated content with `author: AI` in frontmatter
- Human review required before `status: published`
- AI content should be verified for:
  - Technical accuracy
  - Architectural rationale ("the why")
  - Edge cases and limitations

## Analysis Pipeline
Run `scripts/analyze-docs.sh` to:
- Validate frontmatter
- Check for orphaned docs
- Identify gaps in coverage
- Generate coverage report

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. Mixing tutorial content with reference (separate them)
2. Writing how-to guides that assume no prior knowledge (that's a tutorial)
3. Reference docs that explain "why" (move to explanation)
4. Explanation docs with step-by-step instructions (move to how-to)

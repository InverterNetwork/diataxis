# Claude Code Rules

Read and follow the rules in `.cursor/rules/diataxis.mdc` - that file is the canonical ruleset.

## Quick Reference

This is a Diátaxis documentation framework repo:
- `refs/` = raw input (dump docs here)
- `docs/` = refined output (organized by quadrant)

Your job: analyze, categorize, refine, and organize documentation.

## Commands

- `analyze refs` → scan and propose categorization
- `process refs` → full workflow
- `what's missing` → identify gaps

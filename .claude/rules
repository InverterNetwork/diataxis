# Claude Code Rules

**FIRST:** Read `GOAL.md` for user's goal and priorities (never modify it).

Then follow the rules in `.cursor/rules/diataxis.mdc` - the canonical ruleset.

## Quick Reference

This is a Diátaxis documentation framework repo:
- `GOAL.md` = user's goal (read-only for AI)
- `refs/` = raw input (dump docs here)
- `docs/` = refined output (organized by quadrant)

Your job: analyze, categorize, refine, and organize documentation.

## Writing Style

**Docs must be short, scannable, and information-dense.**

- Lead with the point, cut filler
- Bullets/tables over prose
- Active voice, precise words
- Every sentence earns its place

## Commands

- `analyze refs` → scan and propose categorization
- `process refs` → full workflow
- `what's missing` → identify gaps

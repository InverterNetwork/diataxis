# Claude Code Rules

**FIRST:** Read `GOAL.md` for user's goal and priorities (never modify it).

Then follow the rules in `.cursor/rules/diataxis.mdc` - the canonical ruleset.

## Quick Reference

This is a Diátaxis documentation framework repo:
- `GOAL.md` = user's goal (read-only for AI)
- `refs/` = reference material (read-only for AI, user-owned)
- `docs/` = output: tutorials, how-to, explanation (AI creates here)

**CRITICAL:** 
- Never modify, delete, or move files in `refs/`
- refs/ IS the reference documentation—don't recreate it, link to it
- Only create tutorials, how-tos, and explanations in `docs/`

## Writing Style

**Docs must be short, scannable, and information-dense.**

- Lead with the point, cut filler
- Bullets/tables over prose
- Active voice, precise words
- Every sentence earns its place

## Commands

- `analyze refs` → scan and propose categorization
- `process refs` → full workflow
- `what's missing` → identify gaps

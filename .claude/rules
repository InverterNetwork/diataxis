# Claude Code Rules

This project uses a shared ruleset. Read and follow the rules defined in:

→ `.cursor/rules`

That file contains the canonical agent instructions for this repository.

## Quick Context

This is a Diátaxis documentation framework repo:
- `refs/` = raw input (dump docs here)
- `docs/` = refined output (organized by quadrant)

Your job: analyze, categorize, refine, and organize documentation.

## Before Any Documentation Task

1. Read `.cursor/rules` for full framework details
2. Understand the four quadrants (tutorials, how-to, reference, explanation)
3. Follow the agent workflow defined there

## Key Commands

- "analyze refs" → scan and propose categorization
- "process refs" → full workflow
- "what's missing" → identify gaps
